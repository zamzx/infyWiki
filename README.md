V.1 :

Currently - You search, and it scrolls infinitely from articles related to your search. 

this replaces the 'scroll alphabetically' mode since that kept returning boring list-based articles.

potential future features - 


Menu to select mode.
random article mode + better scroll ABC mode. 


LLM driven features ?
